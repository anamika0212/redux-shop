## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform<br />
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API<br />
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem<br />

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state<br />
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider<br />
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state<br />
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store<br />
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br />
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions<br />
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API<br />
